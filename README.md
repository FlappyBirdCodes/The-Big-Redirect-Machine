# The-Big-Redirect-Machine
This was my first ever website built. This program redirects you to a random YouTube video. It was built in html, css and javascript. When the user clicks on a random button, the client side javascript will randomly choose a url from a list or urls. Afterwards, it will redirect you to that url.
